## Chapter 1: Introduction to Amazon Web Service (AWS)

### 1.1 What is Amazon Web Service (AWS)?

Amazon Web Service or AWS is one of the cloud computing service providers that has a worldwide presence. AWS is a very advanced and comprehensive cloud computing service. 

AWS offers a wide range of services for every use, such as basic cloud services, namely computing, storage, and network security to such as blockchain, machine learning, or AI (Artificial Intelligence).

### 1.2 How Does AWS Work?

AWS works with a model that is widely used in cloud computing in general, namely Server-client which can meet many needs. Client-server? what does that mean?

Okay, client server is one of the working scenarios of many computers today, so there are 2 parties, namely the server and the client. The server itself is a computer that is able to serve data based on requests from clients, server computers are able to serve many things, one example is a Web Server which provides Web application services.

For the client itself is a computer that gives requests to the server and receives data or something. An example of a client is like receiving a web-based application with a browser as a service.

In this AWS, we can know that it is very powerful to use, it can be a Web Server, Database Server, and many more. But clearly, AWS tends to be more of a Server-Client scenario, for example a Web Server with AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) which will be learned later.

### 1.3 Cloud Computing

Here we discuss the initial scope related to AWS, namely cloud computing or called Cloud Computing. However, what is Cloud Computing? Cloud Computing is a cloud computing service that can be used and priced according to usage (pay-as-you-go). AWS here uses the concept of thick Cloud Computing, supported by many things. This is an important thing in Cloud Computing:

- Usage as needed, large or small can be adjusted to what is needed.
- Available IT resources, at any time IT resources will always be available.
- Through the Internet, the resource access point can be accessed anywhere, only with an internet connection.

### 1.4 Deployment Model for Cloud Computing 

- Cloud-based Deployment
  Applications are built or migrated entirely to the cloud. Infrastructure can be self-managed or use high-level services to reduce management needs.
- On-premises Deployment
  Also known as private cloud, resources are deployed in a private data center using virtualization technology. This model increases control and utilization of local resources.
- Hybrid Deployment
  Combines cloud and on-premises, where cloud resources are connected to the local data center. Suitable for legacy applications or situations with special regulations regarding local data.

### 1.5 Benefits of Cloud Computing 

- Turn upfront expenses into variable expenses.
- Stop data center management and maintenance costs.
- Stop guessing at capacity.
- Increase speed and agility.
- Go global in minutes.
